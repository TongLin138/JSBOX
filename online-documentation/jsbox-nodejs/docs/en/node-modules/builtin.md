# Built-in Node modules

You can use 3rd-party node modules in JSBox, of course. In order to make your life easier, we bundled a few popular node modules as well:

- [async v3.1.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async)
- [lodash v4.17.15](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash)
- [axios v0.19.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [cheerio v0.22.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio)
- [express v4.17.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [lowdb v1.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lowdb)

You can look for their official documentation if you have no idea how to use them.

We will try to make them up to date as much as we can, you can use your preferred version as well.
