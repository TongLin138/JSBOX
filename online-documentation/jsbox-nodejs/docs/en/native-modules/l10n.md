# module: "l10n"

`l10n` module provides localization support for Node modules.

# Providing localized strings

It's simple, just create a `strings` folder under the project folder, then add your language files there:

```
MyNodeModule/strings
  zh-Hans.strings
  zh-Hant.strings
  en.strings
```

strings is a plain text file with key-value pairs:

```
"KEY1" = "Value1";
"KEY2" = "Value2";
```

# Using localized strings

It's simple to get a localized string with its key:

```js
const l10n = require("l10n");
const localized = l10n("KEY1");
```

The fallback logic:

- No suitable language pack, fallback to English (en)
- No suitable string for a key, fallback to the key itself
