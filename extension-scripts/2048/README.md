# What's this?

Is this a game based on SpriteKit?

Yes and No, this is an example that shows you how to use Objective-C [Runtime](https://docs.xteko.com/#/en/runtime/intro).

Runtime system provided by JSBox is very powerful, we can do many things.

In this project, we want to show you how to:

- Create/inherit native classes dynamically
- Call functions dynamically (reflection)
- Override existing functions dynamically (hook)

Yes, it works like magic, you shouldn't always use Runtime unless you have to do it.

It helps you understand Runtime better, have fun!
