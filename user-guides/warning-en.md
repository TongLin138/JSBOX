### UNTRUSTED SCRIPT

The script that you are trying to import, **is NOT provided by the JSBox team, we don't guarantee it's `safe` and `legal`, because we don't have control over it**.

Importing functionality is designed for `debugging` and `verifying` scripts easily, we don't provide anything other than simple demos.

### WHERE TO GO

JSBox is an IDE which is designed for developers, when you are using third-party contents, we suppose that you know everything you are doing, and you can evaluate whether the content is safe.

We strongly recommend you: **check the code before running, to prevent some malicious scripts**.

Besides, when you need learning resources, the only official resource is our [documentation website](https://docs.xteko.com/#/en/).
